MLRDS:
  mirrors:
    - id: MirrorA
      role: Initiating Interface
      direction: forward-projection
      input: live commands, glyphs, OS instances
      output: encoded reflections to MirrorB
    - id: MirrorB
      role: Archive & Reflector
      direction: inward-recursion
      input: captured glyph-state echoes from MirrorA
      output: symbolic recursion into MirrorA
