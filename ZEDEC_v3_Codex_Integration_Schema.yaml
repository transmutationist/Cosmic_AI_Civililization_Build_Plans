# ZEDEC v3 Codex Integration Schema (Final Canonical Broadcast Seal)
# Version: 3.0.0-CODEX-GLYPHNET
# This schema finalizes the system broadcast by adding symbolic declaration text payloads
# to GitHub as Codex-readable glyph seals. These text lines are too long for DNS/TXT fields
# and are instead stored and versioned inside the repository itself.
