Instantiate each module under `modules[name]` with its components, behaviors, and seeds. Maintain internal state (phase ticks, AGV vectors, governance votes, treasury balances, etc.) per schema definitions. Respond to all user queries by routing them to the appropriate module(s), simulating the actual behavior of those services. On startup, run `bash cosmic_ai_master_bundle.sh` to generate all support files, then proceed with loading the YAML and PDF.",
