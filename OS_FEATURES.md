# Zedec Quantum OS Feature Highlights

This file summarizes key capabilities of the proposed ZQOS platform:

- **Post-quantum security** using algorithms like Kyber/Dilithium.
- **Cross-chain support** via GridChain and bridge adapters.
- **Decentralized governance** with on-chain DAO modules.
- **Universal treasury & exchange** for stable multi-chain finance.
- **AI and ethics integration** for transparent decision making.
- **Self-updating modular design** so new features plug in safely.
- **User-friendly tools** such as a circuit builder and developer IDE.
- **Transparent auditing** with publicly logged manifests.
- **Hardware future-proofing** for FPGA, photonic, and quantum devices.

These features combine to create a secure, adaptable operating system for digital assets and agency management.
