# Build → Launch → Ignition → Live

This short guide summarizes the high-level process for taking the ZEDC Quantum Ecosystem from initial build to a live system. It condenses the detailed phases found in the README and `What_This_Is.txt` into four broad stages.

## 1. Build
- **Setup & Bootstrap**: Prepare the development environment, fetch dependencies, and configure security. Implement the kernel overlays and core modules.
- **Expansion & Modules**: Integrate governance, patch, and agency overlays. Add key modules like SciRD_Lab, HardwareLab, and GridChain. Test compatibility and security at each step.

## 2. Launch
- **Universal Treasury & Exchange**: Deploy the treasury and cross-chain exchange mechanisms.
- **Multi-Chain Bridges**: Connect to all major blockchains and enable quantum audit capabilities via GridChain5D.
- **Governance Activation**: Launch the QuantumCovenant council and enable on-chain DAO voting mechanisms.

## 3. Ignition
- **System Testing**: Run full integration tests, compliance checks, and economic simulations. Publish manifests and audit logs.
- **Network Deployment**: Roll out from devnet to testnet to mainnet, onboarding validators and community agents.
- **Genesis Event**: Finalize the SYSTEM_GENESIS_SEED and broadcast the official ignition signal.

## 4. Live
- **Ongoing Evolution**: Maintain and patch the system. Foster community contributions and continuous expansion of agencies, overlays, and hardware support.
- **Transparent Governance**: Keep DAO voting, audit trails, and ethics gates active so the system remains secure and community-driven.

For more detail on each phase, see `README.md` and `What_This_Is.txt`.
