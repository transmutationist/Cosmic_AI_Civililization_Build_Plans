# Zedec Interface Demo

This directory contains a minimal React component demonstrating the "ZEDEC POST-QUANTUM COSMIC OS" interface mentioned in the project documents.

## Usage

1. Create a new React/Next.js project or add the component to an existing one.
2. Copy `ZedecInterface.tsx` into your `src` directory.
3. Ensure you have `@/components/ui/card` and `@/components/ui/button` or replace them with components from your UI library.
4. Import and render `ZedecInterface` in your application.

The component displays an invocation button. Once pressed, it reveals the initialization sequence and invocation code as described in the repository.

Note: This repository does not include the external assets referenced in the original message (`launch_live.png`, `deploy_live.png`). Those files are stored on a password-protected pCloud link and are not included here.
