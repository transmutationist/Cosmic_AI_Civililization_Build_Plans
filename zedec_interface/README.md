# Zedec Interface

This directory contains a minimal React component implementing the "ZEDEC POST-QUANTUM COSMIC OS" interface described in the repository. It is a lightweight mockup that displays the initialization sequence after invoking the harmonic sequence button.

To integrate this component into a React project, import `ZedecInterface` from `ZedecInterface.tsx` and render it within your application.
