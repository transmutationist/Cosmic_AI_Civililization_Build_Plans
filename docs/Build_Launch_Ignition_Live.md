# Build-Launch-Ignition-Live Guide

This guide provides a concise sequence to move from active development to a live, running network for the Zedec Quantum Ecosystem. It summarizes the build, launch, ignition, and live phases described throughout the repository documentation.

## 1. Build
During the build stage, ensure that the environment is correctly prepared and all core modules compile successfully.

1. **Preflight Setup** – Install dependencies, verify security tools, and fetch open-source libraries.
2. **Kernel Bootstrap** – Implement the ZQOS kernel overlays (vortex math, harmonic checksums, etc.) and confirm they run with the realtime scheduler.
3. **Overlay Expansion** – Integrate governance, agency, and cosmic tracking modules with tests.
4. **Agency Module Scaffold** – Add core modules such as SciRD_Lab, HardwareLab, MMORPG interfaces, DAO logic, and GridChain libraries.

## 2. Launch
Once the build steps pass, prepare for deployment across the network layers.

1. **Treasury and Exchange Integration** – Deploy the universal treasury, connect cross-chain swaps, and finalize monetary policies.
2. **Multi-Chain and Quantum Expansion** – Bridge to external chains and enable GridChain5D auditing for quantum security.
3. **Governance and Healing Systems** – Activate DAO voting, ethics gates, and automated healing protocols.

## 3. Ignition
Ignition marks the first activation of the full system stack on a public network.

1. **Full Testing and Compliance** – Run integration tests, simulated attack scenarios, and publish audit results.
2. **Deployment and Activation** – Launch sequentially to devnet, testnet, and mainnet. Publish genesis seed data and begin validator onboarding.

## 4. Live
When ignition succeeds, the ecosystem moves into its living phase.

1. **Public Onboarding** – Open registration for users, developers, and partner agencies.
2. **Council and Community Operations** – Enable real-time governance participation and maintain open workshops and hackathons.
3. **Perpetual Evolution** – Continue auto-upgrade cycles, documentation updates, and community-driven improvements.
