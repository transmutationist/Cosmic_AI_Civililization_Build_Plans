# Usage Instructions for the AI Model:
# 1. Load `cosmic_ai_index.yaml` as your entrypoint.
# 2. For each listed module:
#     a. Read the specified schema file.
#     b. Register a simulation class under `modules[name]`.
#     c. Instantiate components, configure behaviors, and ingest `seeds`.
# 3. When “Operational Mode” begins, accept natural-language commands,
#    route to the appropriate module(s), and simulate responses as if those
#    services were live.
# 4. Maintain internal state for phase ticks, AGV vectors, governance votes,
#    and pipeline metrics according to the loaded schemas.
# 5. Use the “seeds” metadata to bootstrap initial conditions and test data.

purpose: Provide cosmic, local, and multi-planetary timestamps using geolocation, astrological sign, and φ-scaled epochs.
description: |

  AstroTime (13-sign zodiac with Ophiuchus), and φ-epoch counters.
components:
  geo_time:
    inputs: GPS coordinates (lat, long)
    outputs: local solar time, NTP-synced UTC
    sync: GPS PPS pulse for ±1µs accuracy
  astro_zodiac:
    signs: [Aries…Pisces,Ophiuchus]
    calculation:
      - sidereal_position(date, coords) → zodiac_sign
      - φ_fractional_day(date) → cosmic_fraction
  epoch_counter:
    hrtimer: base interval = 10ms
    φ_epoch: increments at φ×interval
    global_tick: uint64 counter
  timestamp_formatter:
    format: "{local_time} | {zodiac_sign}:{degree} | φ#{epoch}"
    use: annotate all log entries, manifest entries, phase messages
seeds:
  - "GPS.PPS – precise time sync"

# --- Recursive Agency & Sub-Agency Manager ---
name: AgencyHierarchyManager
purpose: Orchestrate fractal expansion of governance agencies, sub-agencies, and AI agents under the Tree of Life model.
description: |
  Dynamically spawns or updates governance branches and sub-agencies in recursive tree structures, 
  each with full overlays and checks, ensuring per-branch autonomy and cosmic compliance.
components:
  root_agency:
    name: DivineCouncil
    branches: 11 core (Keter…Malkuth)
  sub_agency_spawn:
    trigger: new domain/team/project
    procedure:
      - inherit parent overlays (geometry + numerology)
      - assign new digitalRoot ID
      - register in AGENT_MAP.json

    per_branch: 3 agents (Chat, Code, UI) → total 33
    metadata: {role, version, cred_score}

    rules:
      - PHI checksum on branch aggregates
      - no cycles (acyclic tree)
      - max depth configurable
  storage:
    file: AGENT_MAP.json
    format: {branch: {sub_agencies:[], agents:[]}}

# --- Manifest & Lineage Manager ---
name: ManifestLineageService
purpose: Maintain authoritative manifests (SYSTEM.json, AGENT_MAP.json, PATCH_MANIFEST.json) with cryptographic lineage.
description: |
  Records every structural, configuration, and governance change as immutable entries, chained by φ-checksum,
  enabling full audit, rollback, and self-healing of the system state.

  manifest_api:
    endpoints:
      - GET /manifest/{name}

      - GET /manifest/{name}/history
  lineage_chaining:
    method: append-only journal with φ-hash of previous entry
    fields: {timestamp, user/agent, action, data, φ_hash}
  self_healing:
    watchdog: detects manifest inconsistency
    procedure:
      - verify φ_hash chain
      - revert to last known-good entry
  storage:
    backend: Git repository + object storage for snapshots
